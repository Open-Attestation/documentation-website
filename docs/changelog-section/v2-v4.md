## Major changes from OA v2.0

This section briefly describes the changes from OpenAttestation (OA) v2.0 to v4.0. For more information and examples of these changes, refer to our [guide on upgrading to v4.0](/docs/guides-section/upgrading-to-v4).

## Modified properties

The following properties that existed in OA v2.0 have been restructured or moved to newly named properties in v4.0 to comply with [W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/).

### Credential Subject

Previously located at the root level of raw documents or nested under `data` (if already wrapped/signed), the claims about the subject of the credential are now always nested under `credentialSubject`.

### Credential Status

Previously specified in `issuers[i].revocation`, the revocation type and location are now specified in `credentialStatus` and is now an optional property to be set if applicable.

### Issuer

Instead of the original `issuers` array in OA v2.0, v4.0 uses the W3C `issuer` property containing similar data about the id, name, and identity proof of the document. To facilitate interoperability with other verifiers, there is now an added property `issuer.type` which in the case of OA v4.0 should always be set to `OpenAttestationIssuer`.

### Render Method

Previously specified in `$template`, details about rendering the document are now specified in `renderMethod`.

## New properties

The following are new properties that have been added in OA v4.0 to comply with [W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/):

### The `context` property

Added in OA v4 to provide semantics of the terms used in the document via JSON-LD contexts. This property should be an array of URLs pointing to JSON-LD contexts.

In OA v4, the array must start with these two context URLs:

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2",
    "https://schemata.openattestation.com/com/openattestation/4.0/context.json"
  ]
}
```

### The `type` property

Added in OA v4 to specify the JSON-LD context type of document. This property should be an array of strings for the expression of object type information.

In OA v4, the array must start with these 2 context types:

```json
{
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "OpenAttestationCredential"]
}
```

## Status of OA v3.0

OpenAttestation v3.0 has been deprecated in favour of v4.0
