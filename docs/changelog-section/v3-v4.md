## Major changes from V3

This section describes some major changes from the OpenAttestation V3 Data Model.

### Removal of the `version` field

The `version` field used in OA V3 is not part of the Verifiable Credential base context. For the OA framework to easily identify the version of the Verifiable Credential, OA V4 will now instead rely on the expanded URI where `@type` contains: 

https://schema.openattestation.com/4.0/credentials#OpenAttestationCredential

### Removal of the `openAttestationMetadata` field

In OA V3, `openAttestationMetadata` is used to specify details about the document, identity proof, proof, and template. 

As per W3Câ€™s data model V2.0, OA V4 will now instead reference those details from the `issuer`, `credentialStatus` and `renderMethod` properties respectively.

### Change in OpenAttestation specific `@contexts`

Previously, multiple context values would be provided in order to provide the semantic meaning for each field. In OA V4, a single JSON-LD context definition along with the declared types can be used to give semantic meaning to all OpenAttestation specific fields. 

For example:
```
{
 "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
    "https://schema.openattestation.com/4.0/credentials"
  ],
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "OpenAttestationCredential"],
  // ...
}
```
