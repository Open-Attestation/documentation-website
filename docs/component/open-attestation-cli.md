The OpenAttestation CLI is a binary that allows you to interact with an OpenAttestation document directly. It can also be used to interact with different types of smart contracts on the Ethereum network.

## Installation (binary)

To install the binary, simply download the binary from the [CLI release page](https://github.com/Open-Attestation/open-attestation-cli/releases) for your OS.

## Installation (npm)

Alternatively for Linux or MacOS users, if you have `npm` installed on your machine, you may install the cli using the following command:

```sh
npm install -g @govtechsg/open-attestation-cli
```

Installation using this method will install the CLI globally on your machine and you may run the binary by running:

```sh
open-attestation
```

## Usage Instructions

For usage instructions, refer to the [CLI README](https://github.com/Open-Attestation/open-attestation-cli) or run the CLI with the help flag:

```sh
open-attestation --help
```

> In all the guides, we will refer to the CLI as `open-attestation` when running a command. That means we will assume the CLI is available in your execution path. If it's not the case, you will to change `open-attestation` by the full path to the executable.
