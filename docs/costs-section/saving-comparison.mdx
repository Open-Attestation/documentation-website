If you are a new user of TradeTrust or going to deploy a new token registry (i.e. transferable document), it is recommended to try V4.

You will be able to try the new features in this version and benefit from massive cost savings when deploying your contracts. 

This page provides an estimated breakdown of the differences in gas fees between the two versions and the amount of savings you can get using V4.

Using V4 contracts, you can save up to approximately 92% in total gas fees compared to its previous versions. If the costs on Ethereum is still a concern despite the savings, you can deploy onto the Polygon network, where the V4 repository comes pre-configured. The estimations on this page are based on the current prices on the Ethereum and Polygon Mainnet.

If you are interested in V4, check out [this repository](https://github.com/Open-Attestation/token-registry/tree/master).

>**Note:** The following estimation is **not** a comprehensive list of all the costs involved and should be used as only a reference. The live gas fees and prices on this page are updated every 15s. The data is retrieved from [BlockNative Gas Estimator](https://www.blocknative.com/gas-estimator) and [CryptoCompare](https://www.cryptocompare.com/).
