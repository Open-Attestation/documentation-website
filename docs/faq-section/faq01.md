OpenAttestation documents (OA documents) are a type of verifiable documents or verifiable credentials.

As our transactions become increasingly digital, there is a need to ensure that the legitimacy of credentials such as certificates, licenses or permits is verifiable. 

OpenAttestation documents are cryptographically secure and hence tamper-resistant. Using OpenAttestation, any user can check who issued the document, and whether the document has been revoked so that it is no longer valid. These verifications are always performed at the point of viewing (before the document displays).
