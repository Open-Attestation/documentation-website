In brief, the verification flow runs three checks on the document:

1. The document integrity check
1. The issuance status check
1. The issuance identity check

Only when it passes all three checks, will it count as a valid OA document.

The verification process varies on the documents issued with Ethereum and those signed with DID. To learn more, see [OpenAttestation (Verify)](/docs/lib-section/remote-files/open-attestation-verify) with explanation and flowcharts.
