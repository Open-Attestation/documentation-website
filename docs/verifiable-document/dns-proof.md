Every OA document's provenance can be verified and traced back to its creator or issuer. This is achieved by embedding an `identityProof` property in the document, which serves as a claim for identity. During the verification phase, the claim is checked against external records.

In this guide, we will bind the document issuer's identity to a valid domain name. This domain will be displayed as issuer every time the document is rendered in an OA-compliant decentralized renderer.

![Example Issuer Identity](/docs/verifiable-document/dns-proof/example.png)

In this example above, the document's issuer is bound to `demo.openattestation.com`.

With your [document store](/docs/verifiable-document/document-store), run the following command:

```bash
open-attestation dns txt-record create --address 0xBBb55Bd1D709955241CAaCb327A765e2b6D69c8b --network-id 3
```

The `network-id` corresponds to the [network ID for the different Ethereum networks](https://chainid.network/). We generally use only the following networks:

| Network ID | Name                     | Network   |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | --------- |
| `1`        | Ethereum Mainnet         | `mainnet` |
| `3`        | Ethereum Testnet Ropsten | `ropsten` |
| `4`        | Ethereum Testnet Rinkeby | `rinkeby` |

Once the DNS TXT record has been successfully deployed, you will see the success message with the bound location.

```text
✔  success   Record created at few-green-cat.sandbox.openattestation.com and will stay valid until Thu Jul 02 2020 14:51:40 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time)
```

In the example above, the document store `0xBBb55Bd1D709955241CAaCb327A765e2b6D69c8b`, has been bound to the `few-green-cat.sandbox.openattestation.com` location. Let's make sure the entry has been propagated to the DNS:

```bash
open-attestation dns txt-record get --location few-green-cat.sandbox.openattestation.com
```

which will display to you the list of the DNS TXT records associated to that location.

```text
┌─────────┬────────────┬────────────┬───────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────┬────────┐

└─────────┴────────────┴────────────┴───────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────┴────────┘
```

> Note that it can take some time for the record to be correctly propagated to the DNS, even though it usually takes 10 to 15s.
