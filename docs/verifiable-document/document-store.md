The document store is a smart contract on the Ethereum network that records the issuance and revocation status of OA documents. In this guide, we will deploy a document store smart contract on the Ethereum `ropsten` network, which is a test network that does not require actual [ethers](/docs/appendix/glossary#ether) for transactions.

## Deployment Methods

Currently, we provide two ways of deploying the document store smart contract onto Ethereum:

- [TradeTrust Admin Portal](https://admin.tradetrust.io/) or [Opencerts Admin Portal](https://admin.opencerts.io/) , a web app
- [Open Attestation CLI](https://github.com/Open-Attestation/open-attestation-cli), a command line tool

They are both decentralized apps (Dapps) as both enable you to interact with smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Using Open Attestation CLI

### Prerequisites

- [OpenAttestation CLI](../../component/open-attestation-cli) installed
- A wallet on ropsten network (for instance using [Metamask](/docs/appendix/ropsten-setup))
- The wallet private key
- [Exposing the wallet private key to the CLI for write operations](../../component/open-attestation-cli#writing-operations)

### Deploying the store

```bash
open-attestation deploy document-store "My first document store" --network ropsten
```

Once your document store smart contract has been successfully deployed, you will see the success message with the document store address.

```text
âœ”  success   Document store My first document store deployed at 0xE1aF9E29c9548659e8b2D93a8750f40CE912ef15
```

In the example above, the document store address is `0xE1aF9E29c9548659e8b2D93a8750f40CE912ef15`, please do **NOT** use the Transaction ID.

**Save the document store address in your notepad as the web app does not keep track of your document store addresses.** You will need this address to complete the tutorial.

You can now continue to the [next guide](./dns-proof)

## Using a web app

### Prerequisites

- Google Chrome web browser
- Metamask setup, refer to the [Test Account Setup](/docs/appendix/ropsten-setup) section for the setup guide

### Change Metamask Network to Ropsten

![Connecting Metamask to Ropsten](/docs/verifiable-document/document-store/ropsten.png)

Connect Metamask to the Ethereum `ropsten` network by selecting _Ropsten Test Network_ in the Google Chrome plugin's header. You may be asked to log in at this step if you have not done so.

### Connect Metamask to Web App

![Admin Interface](/docs/verifiable-document/document-store/interface.png)

To interact with the TradeTrust Admin Portal web app, you will need to connect your Metamask wallet. Select _Metamask_ on the web app to connect it to your Metamask wallet.

![Metamask Connection Request](/docs/verifiable-document/document-store/connection-request.png)

Click on _Connect_ to allow the web app to interact with Metamask wallet.

### Deploying Document Store Smart Contract

![Filling in Organization name](/docs/verifiable-document/document-store/deploy.png)

Enter your organization name as the _Issuer Name_ and click _Deploy_ to deploy the document store as an Ethereum smart contract.

![Confirming Transaction](/docs/verifiable-document/document-store/confirmation.png)

After clicking on _Deploy_, you will be asked to confirm the transaction in a separate popup. Click _Confirm_ to continue.

![Successful deployment](/docs/verifiable-document/document-store/success.png)

Once your document store smart contract has been successfully deployed, you will see the success message with the document store address. In the example above, the document store address is `0xED2E50434Ac3623bAD763a35213DAD79b43208E4`, please do **NOT** use the Transaction ID.

**Save the document store address in your notepad as the web app does not keep track of your document store addresses.** You will need this address to complete the tutorial.
