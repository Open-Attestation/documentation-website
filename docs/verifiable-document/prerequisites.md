Before we start, you will need the OpenAttestation CLI correctly setup. Head to the [intallation page](/docs/component/open-attestation-cli), and make sure the following command works:

```bash
open-attestation --version
```

> In the event you need to change the binary name or the path to the binary, makes sure to change the example above accordingly as well as all the commands we will run throughout the guide.
