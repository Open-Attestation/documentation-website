After issuing documents using Ethereum or signing documents using DID, you need to perform a verification on the documents to ensure that they are valid for distribution.

In a compatible verifier, drag an OA document and drop it on the file selection pane. If the verification is successful, the verifier will show three green checkmarks. 

In addition to OpenCerts and TradeTrust, you can also use any other verifier compatible with OpenAttestation.
