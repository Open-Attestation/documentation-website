## OA document schema

The OpenAttestation v2.0 defines the shape of data for the `raw document` - the data before the wrapping process. It is defined in [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) format.

The official OpenAttestation v2.0 schema can be found at https://schema.openattestation.com/2.0/schema.json

## Using online schema validator

For this guide, you will use an online JSON Schema validator to write the raw document.

### Setting up the JSON schema validator with OA schema

Visit https://www.jsonschemavalidator.net/

Paste the contents from https://schema.openattestation.com/2.0/schema.json into the left panel under "Select Schema".

This will setup the JSON schema validator to validate the JSON inputs on the right against the defined schema.

If you start editing the JSON data on the right you should see errors if the data does not conform to the OpenAttestation v2.0 schema. A summary of the number of errors is found on top of the right panel and the details of the errors are found below the two panels.
