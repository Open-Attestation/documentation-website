Multiple documents can be wrapped at the same time in a single batch operation, creating a single checksum for the entire batch of raw documents. 

In this task, you will learn how to generate the checksum by running the `wrapping` process.

You will use the CLI tool to read all the files in the `raw-documents` folder, wrap them, and then output the files in another directory `wrapped-documents`.

A `merkleRoot`, a 64 character long string prepended with `0x` will be generated. The `merkleRoot` is the only information that will be used to verify the issuance status of an OA document.
