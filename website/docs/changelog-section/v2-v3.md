## Supported document types

OpenAttestation V3 is available for different types of document (transferable record & verifiable document) and different type of identity methods (`DNS-TXT`, `DNS-DID` & `DID`).

For a range of the different types of supported documents that have gone through testing:

1. See how the documents are generated [here](https://github.com/Open-Attestation/oa-verify/blob/master/scripts/generate.v3.ts).
1. See how the documents look like [here](https://github.com/Open-Attestation/oa-verify/tree/master/test/fixtures/v3).
1. See how the test output for different types of document looks like [here](https://github.com/Open-Attestation/oa-verify/blob/master/src/verify.v3.integration.test.ts).

For bug report and support, you can create an issue [here](https://github.com/Open-Attestation/open-attestation/issues).

## Major changes from V2

This section describes some major changes from the OpenAttestation V2 Data Model.

### The context property

The `@context` property is introduced as per [W3C VC Care Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#contexts). Using this property, the issuer can map short-form aliases to the URIs required by specific verifiable credentials and verifiable presentations.

OpenAttestation has released its extension to W3C credentials context via `https://schemata.openattestation.com/com/openattestation/1.0/OpenAttestation.v3.json`

### Credential subject

Previously stored in the `data` key, the claims about the subject of the credential should now be placed in the `credentialSubject` field.

### Metadata

Previously mixed into the `data` object, additional metadata that is crucial in verifying the document integrity or provenance and displaying the document has been moved into the `openAttestationMetadata` field.

### Issuer

Instead of allowing multiple issuers as in OA V2, V3 has a restriction that there can be only one entity named `issuer` of the verifiable credentials. For use cases where there are different entities to issue the document together, the entities will need to [choose a way to signal intent from multiple participants on the blockchain](https://geek.sg/blog/comparing-different-ways-to-signal-intent-from-multiple-participants-on-the-blockchain).

### Data access

In the previous version, every value in the document is made into a string with a random salt pre-pended as a method to protect against the rainbow table attack on the obfuscated value. This results in the need for the `getData` method which strips the salt and change the type of the value back to the original type.

In the upgrade, the random salt has been moved to `proof.salts` to be pre-pended to the individual values only at the checksum verification stage. This makes the data of the VC directly accessible without the `getData` method.

sidebar_label: Quick Start
-->
## Quick start (V3 Beta)
You will issue a driving license in the OpenAttestation Version 3 format. You will be using the document store to issue this document with `DNS-TXT` as the method to identify the issuer using DNS.

>**Note:** The document will not be rendered, as the demo renderer is currently unavailable. For a full range of documents (beside document store and `DNS-TXT`), you may look at the different types of document supported [here](#supported-document-types).

### Document store setup

If you have not deployed a document store:

- If you are using the Ethereum method, see [this guide](/docs/ethereum-section/document-store).

- If you are using the DID method, see [this guide](/docs/did-section/document-store-or-ocsp).

### Creating raw document

In this step, you will create the data for the driving license. 

Create a file `license.json` with the following data:

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
    "https://schemata.openattestation.com/com/openattestation/1.0/DrivingLicenceCredential.json",
    "https://schemata.openattestation.com/com/openattestation/1.0/OpenAttestation.v3.json",
    "https://schemata.openattestation.com/com/openattestation/1.0/CustomContext.json"
  ],
  "reference": "SERIAL_NUMBER_123",
  "name": "Republic of Singapore Driving License",
  "issuanceDate": "2010-01-01T19:23:24Z",
  "validFrom": "2010-01-01T19:23:24Z",
  "issuer": { "id": "https://example.com", "name": "DEMO STORE", "type": "OpenAttestationIssuer" },
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "DrivingLicenseCredential", "OpenAttestationCredential"],
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:example:JOHN_DOE_DID",
    "licenseNumber": "S1234567a",
    "birthDate": "1977-02-22",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "class": [
      { "type": "3", "effectiveDate": "2010-01-01T19:23:24Z" },
      { "type": "3A", "effectiveDate": "2010-01-01T19:23:24Z" }
    ]
  },
  "openAttestationMetadata": {
    "template": {
      "name": "DRIVING_LICENSE",
      "type": "EMBEDDED_RENDERER",
      "url": "https://tutorial-renderer.openattestation.com"
    },
    "proof": {
      "type": "OpenAttestationProofMethod",
      "method": "DID",
      "value": "did:ethr:0xE712878f6E8d5d4F9e87E10DA604F9cB564C9a89",
      "revocation": {
        "type": "NONE"
      }
    },
    "identityProof": {
      "type": "DNS-DID",
      "identifier": "example.tradetrust.io"
    }
  },
  "attachments": [{ "fileName": "sample.pdf", "mimeType": "application/pdf", "data": "BASE64_ENCODED_FILE" }]
}
```

You will need to replace the following values:

#### Replacing the proof value in metadata

Replace `openAttestationMetadata.proof.value` with the address of the document store deployed in [this step](/docs/ethereum-section/document-store).

#### Replacing the identity proof identifier

Replace `openAttestationMetadata.identityProof.identifier` with the domain where the TXT record has been inserted in [this step](/docs/ethereum-section/dns-proof).

### Wrapping the document

After [installing the CLI](/docs/lib-section/remote-files/open-attestation-cli) and saving the `license.json` file, run the command below:

```sh
open-attestation wrap license.json --of wrapped.json --oav3
```

The will wrap the original document and append the additional data that OpenAttestation requires to the `proof` key at the root of the document.

### Issuing document

If you are using the `DID` method to issue the document, you can sign the document with the private key corresponding to the issuing DID configured.

This example signs the document with the did `did:ethr:0xE712878f6E8d5d4F9e87E10DA604F9cB564C9a89`. You need to use your own DID to sign documents.

To sign the document, run the following command:

```sh
open-attestation sign wrapped.json --output-dir signed --public-key did:ethr:0xE712878f6E8d5d4F9e87E10DA604F9cB564C9a89#controller --key 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

>**Note:** Replace both the public key and private key with those associated with your DID.

### Verifying document

In this step, you will see a file `wrapped.json` created in the folder `signed`. You can verify the document with the following command:

```sh
open-attestation verify -d signed/wrapped.json
```

Upon successful verification, you will see the output:

```txt
…  awaiting  Verifying signed/wrapped.json
✔  success   The document is valid
```

>**Note:** Alternatively, you can verify the document on [OpenCerts](https://www.opencerts.io/) or [TradeTrust](https://www.tradetrust.io/).

## Creating custom context
For v3 documents in OpenAttestation, a major change consists of a `@context` property introduced into the document. Refer [here](#the-context-property) for more information.

This guide shows you how to create a custom context.

### Document (invoice)

![Invoice](/docs/docs-section/roadmap/invoice-sample.png)

A document like the one shown above (an Invoice), would typically contain multiple fields which in this case, it contains those that are necessary such as, `billTo` and `billFrom`. More fields could be added into the form, however this would mean that the document may contain fields that are not already defined or required.

The use of `@context` would provide an additional layer of validation to ensure that the document only contains what has already been defined as required.

The rest of this guide will use the example invoice above as a reference.

### Context object

```json
{
  "@context": [
    {
      "@version": 1.1
    },
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/odrl.jsonld",
    {
      "id": "@id",
      "date": {
        "@type": "xsd:string"
      },
      "customerId": {
        "@type": "xsd:string"
      },
      "terms": {
        "@type": "xsd:string"
      },
      "subtotal": {
        "@type": "xsd:string"
      },
      "tax": {
        "@type": "xsd:string"
      },
      "taxTotal": {
        "@type": "xsd:string"
      },
      "total": {
        "@type": "xsd:string"
      },
      "billFrom": {
        "@id": "https://schemata.openattestation.com/vocab/#billFrom",
        "@context": {
          "name": {
            "@type": "xsd:string"
          },
          "streetAddress": {
            "@type": "xsd:string"
          },
          "city": {
            "@type": "xsd:string"
          },
          "postalCode": {
            "@type": "xsd:string"
          },
          "phoneNumber": {
            "@type": "xsd:string"
          }
        }
      }
      // other properties
    }
  ]
}
```

The object above in `.json` format, shows how a `@context` object looks like. For the `Invoice` document, a `@context` as such could be created. As seen, it contains fields that you would find in the actual image of the `Invoice`:

- `id` : ID of the document in `string` format
- `date`: Date of the `Invoice` in `string` format
- `customerId` : ID of the customer in `string` format
- ...

This `.json` could then be published in a place that could be referenced using a URL link. In this guide, the URL link for the context created above would be represented with `https://schemata.openattestation.com/io/tradetrust/invoice/1.0/invoice-context.json`.

>**Note:** The `xsd` in `xsd:string` is used to represent data types in these documents.

### Raw document (invoice)

```json
{
  "version": "https://schema.openattestation.com/3.0/schema.json",
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
    "https://schemata.openattestation.com/io/tradetrust/invoice/1.0/invoice-context.json",
    "https://schemata.openattestation.com/com/openattestation/1.0/OpenAttestation.v3.json"
  ],
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "OpenAttestationCredential"],
  "issuanceDate": "2010-01-01T19:23:24Z",
  "issuer": { ... },
  "openAttestationMetadata": { ... },
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "id:example",
    "date": "2018-02-21",
    "customerId": "564",
    "terms": "Due Upon Receipt",
    "billFrom": {
      "name": "ABC Company",
      "streetAddress": "Level 1, Industry Offices",
      "city": "Singapore",
      "postalCode": "123456",
      "phoneNumber": "60305029"
    },
    "billTo": {
      "company": {
        "name": "DEF Company",
        "streetAddress": "Level 2, Industry Offices",
        "city": "Singapore",
        "postalCode": "612345",
        "phoneNumber": "61204028"
      },
      "name": "James Lee",
      "email": "def@company.com"
    }
    // other properties
  }
}
```

The `.json` above shows the structure of the `Invoice`'s raw document. The context created earlier, can be seen to be included in the `@context` field as a URL link.

During the [wrapping](/docs/lib-section/remote-files/open-attestation-cli#wrapping-documents) process, the document itself as well as the fields inside `credentialSubject` would be validated and cross checked against the contexts defined in `@context`.

>**Note:** It is not necessary that everything in `@context` has to appear in `credentialSubject`. But when there are additional items in `credentialSubject` that do not exist in what has already been defined in `@context`, an error would occur when trying to wrap the document.

### Configuration file (invoice)

```json
{
  "network": "sepolia",
  "wallet": {
    "type": "ENCRYPTED_JSON",
    "encryptedJson": "{\"address\":\"1245e5b64d785b25057f7438f715f4aa5d965733\",\"id\":\"bf069d1b-4e88-487c-b695-f2e03ed7c1ff\",\"version\":3, ...}"
  },
  "forms": [
    {
      "name": "Invoice",
      "type": "VERIFIABLE_DOCUMENT",
      "defaults": {
        "version": "https://schema.openattestation.com/3.0/schema.json",
        "@context": [
          "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
          "https://schemata.openattestation.com/io/tradetrust/invoice/1.0/invoice-context.json",
          "https://schemata.openattestation.com/com/openattestation/1.0/OpenAttestation.v3.json"
        ],
        "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "OpenAttestationCredential"],
        "issuanceDate": "2010-01-01T19:23:24Z",
        "issuer": {
          "id": "https://example.com",
          "name": "DEMO STORE",
          "type": "OpenAttestationIssuer"
        },
        "openAttestationMetadata": {...},
        "credentialSubject": {}
      },
      "schema": {...}
    }
  ]
}
```

The `.json` above shows the structure of the `Invoice`'s configuration file. Apart from the rest of the information such as `schema`, that contains custom fields to be filled in during the creation of the document, the `@context` created for the `Invoice` earlier, could also be seen to be included.

Similarly, the items inside `@context` contain the types of what are the different fields required in the document. It would be used to cross check against the items that have been filled in inside `schema` to ensure that the document created using this configuration file does not contain anything more than what has already been defined in `@context`.


>**Note:** It is not necessary that everything in `@context` has to appear in `schema`. But when there are additional items in `schema` that do not exist in what has already been defined in `@context`, an error would occur when trying to create a document.
