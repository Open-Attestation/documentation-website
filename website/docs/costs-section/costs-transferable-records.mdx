This article breaks down the estimated gas and costs involved in interacting with the contracts.
The estimated gas usage can be slightly different depending on the states of the contract when it is called. The gas prices and fiat costs are constantly changing and you should check the numbers from a reliable source to get an accurate figure.

>**Note:** The following estimation is **not** a comprehensive list of all the costs involved and should be used as only a reference. The live gas fees and prices on this page are updated every 15s. The data is retrieved from [BlockNative Gas Estimator](https://www.blocknative.com/gas-estimator) and [CryptoCompare](https://www.cryptocompare.com/).
