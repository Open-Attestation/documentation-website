As a developer, you may find multiple repositories or libraries used throughout this documentation website and want to find out the different packages you can use to implement your own components. This section provides an overview of what you can build with all the repositories and their respective documentation for you to get started.

Using the repositories below, you can achieve the following:

-  Create OpenAttestation (OA) documents such as transferable records or verifiable documents with the [OpenAttestation](/docs/developer-section/libraries/remote-files/open-attestation) core framework.
-  Create and verify OA documents as well as issue these documents to the blockchain in the command line interface using the [OpenAttestation (CLI)](/docs/developer-section/libraries/remote-files/open-attestation-cli).
- Share and store your OA documents in a secure way with [OpenAttestation (Encryption)](/docs/developer-section/libraries/remote-files/open-attestation-encryption).
- Verify OA documents with [OpenAttestation (Verify)](/docs/developer-section/libraries/remote-files/open-attestation-verify).
-  Publish verifiable documents on the blockchain and retrieve them with [Document Store](/docs/developer-section/libraries/remote-files/document-store) using smart contracts. 
- Publish transferable records on the blockchain and retrieve them with [Token Registry](/docs/developer-section/libraries/remote-files/token-registry) using smart contracts.
- Recipients can view their OA documents in a human-readable format with [Decentralized Renderer](/docs/developer-section/libraries/remote-files/decentralized-renderer/decentralized-renderer-react-components).
