OA documents are both machine- and human-readable. Each OA document file is stored in a `.json` format, which helps any application process the content more easily. To present the data file in a human-readable format, a renderer needs to be written.

In this guide, you will build and deploy the renderer to display data from a ðŸ“œ Certificate of Completion.

This renderer is a static website that will be embedded in compliant OA viewer. It will take in the OA document in the raw form and generates the corresponding HTML code for rendering.

## Prerequisites

- Download [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and install it on your computer.
- Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and install it on your computer.
- Have your [GitHub account](https://github.com/) registered to access the repositories.
- Have your [Netlify account](https://www.netlify.com/) registered to deploy your document renderer site.
- Get [basic React.js and TypeScript knowledge](https://reactjs.org/) to develop your document renderer.

## Cloning the decentralized renderer React template

Download a template for building your own document renderer from [the OpenAttestation template repository](https://github.com/Open-Attestation/decentralized-renderer-react-template).

### Cloning the code repository locally

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Open-Attestation/decentralized-renderer-react-template.git
cd decentralized-renderer-react-template
rm -rf .git
```

### Cleaning the template

To develop a renderer that works properly, start with cleaning the template:

- Remove the folder `src/templates/customTemplate`
- Remove the folder `src/integration`

Once you have finished the tutorial, you can clone the repository again and examine the deleted files.

### Installing the code dependencies

Run the command below:

```sh
npm install
```

### Running the development preview

Run the command below:

```sh
npm run storybook
```

### Development environment
After running the Storybook, you will see the template samples at `http://localhost:6006/`.

This is a live preview to see the changes when you:

1. Edit the raw document data in the **Knobs** tab
1. Edit the template code to render the data

## Developing the document renderer

After setting up the development environment, start writing our document renderer. 

1. Define the data structure of our ðŸ“œ Certificate of Completion (COC).

2. Write the renderer to render the HTML code for the data provided.

### Updating the sample document data and type

To update the raw document data and the corresponding data type, edit the data definition file at `src/templates/samples/customTemplateSample.ts`:

```typescript jsx
import { v2 } from "@govtechsg/open-attestation";

export interface CocTemplateCertificate extends v2.OpenAttestationDocument {
  name: string;
  recipient: {
    name: string;
  };
}

export const cocTemplateCertificate: CocTemplateCertificate = {
  name: "OpenAttestation Tutorial Certificate of Completion",
  issuers: [
    {
      name: "My name",
      documentStore: "0xBBb55Bd1D709955241CAaCb327A765e2b6D69c8b",
      identityProof: {
        location: "few-green-cat.sandbox.openattestation.com",
        type: v2.IdentityProofType.DNSTxt,
      },
    },
  ],
  recipient: {
    name: "John Doe",
  },
  $template: {
    name: "COC",
    type: v2.TemplateType.EmbeddedRenderer,
    url: "http://localhost:3000",
  },
};
```

### Document objects explained

In the above OA document, you will see four root objects:

#### 1. `$template`

The `$template` key describes the template name used to render this display. It should have the following keys:

- `$template.name` is the name of the template used to render a given OA document. This enables a single document renderer to render multiple types of OA documents, each with a different template name.

- `$template.type` will always take the value of `EMBEDDED_RENDERER` for documents rendered in this way.

- `$template.url` will be the remote URL where your OA decentralized renderer resides. For now, set it to `https://localhost:3000` but you need to change this value later on in the [Deploying the document renderer](#deploying-the-document-renderer) section.

#### 2. `name`

The `name` key is a compulsory key to describe the OA document type. In this case, you are creating an `OpenAttestation Tutorial Certificate of Completion`.

#### 3. `recipient`

OA documents do not have a strict data structure and lets issuers of documents define their own data schema. The `recipient` object is a user-defined object that describes who the certificate is conferred to. In this case, replace `John Doe` with the actual recipient name.

>**Note:** This guide focuses on the simple document. In the [next tutorial](/docs/developer-section/quickstart/create-custom-schema.md), you will learn more about the OA document schema and how to define a custom data structure. 

#### 4. `issuers`

For more details, see [Creating raw document](/docs/integrator-section/verifiable-document/ethereum/raw-document#creating-raw-document).

### Developing the COC template view

After you defined the structure of data, the next step is to style the ðŸ“œ Certificate of Completion.

To change how the data is being rendered, create a React component that takes in the raw document in the `document` props and render the corresponding HTML code.

Your ðŸ“œ Certificate of Completion will display some text similar to the following:

```text
OpenAttestation Tutorial Certificate of Completion
awarded to
John Doe
```

1. Create a file named `src/templates/coc/template.tsx` with the following content:

```jsx harmony
import React, { FunctionComponent } from "react";
import { TemplateProps } from "@govtechsg/decentralized-renderer-react-components";
import { css } from "@emotion/core";
import { CocTemplateCertificate } from "../samples/customTemplateSample";

const containerStyle = css`
  background-color: #324353;
  color: #ffffff;
  padding: 15px;
  margin: auto;
  width: 80%;
  text-align: center;
`;

export const CocTemplate: FunctionComponent<TemplateProps<CocTemplateCertificate> & { className?: string }> = ({
  document,
  className = "",
}) => {
  return (
    <div css={containerStyle} className={className} id="custom-template">
      <h1>{document.name}</h1>
      <div>awarded to</div>
      <h2>{document.recipient.name}</h2>
    </div>
  );
};
```

2. Add a story to view it. 

    At the same level with `src/templates/coc/template.tsx`, create a file named `template.stories.mdx` with the following content:

```markdown
import { Meta, Preview, Props, Description, Story } from "@storybook/addon-docs/blocks";
import { object } from "@storybook/addon-knobs";
import { CocTemplate } from "./template";
import { cocTemplateCertificate } from "../samples/customTemplateSample";

<Meta title="MDX|CocTemplate" component={CocTemplate} />

# CocTemplate component

<Description of={CocTemplate} />

# Props

<Props of={CocTemplate} />

# Usage

<Preview>
  <Story name="basic sample">
    <CocTemplate document={object("document", cocTemplateCertificate)} />
  </Story>
</Preview>
```

3. [Start the storybook](#running-the-development-preview). 

    Make sure your component looks like the following:

![Completed Story Book View](/docs/developer-section/quickstart/custom-renderer/completed-storybook.png)

### Certificate of Completion template configuration

An OA document can have multiple views, with each rendered in a separate tab. For example, an OA document that is a degree certificate may have the actual certificate as one view, and the transcript as another view in a single template. 


A demo of the multiple-view feature is available [here](https://opencerts.io/?q=%7B%22type%22%3A%22DOCUMENT%22%2C%22payload%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.opencerts.io%2Fstatic%2Fdemo%2Fhomestead.opencert%22%2C%22permittedActions%22%3A%5B%22STORE%22%5D%2C%22redirect%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fopencerts.io%22%7D%7D).

Your ðŸ“œ Certificate of Completion will only use a single view. 

Create a file named `src/templates/coc/index.tsx` with the following content:

```js
import { CocTemplate } from "./template";

export const templates = [
  {
    id: "certificate",
    label: "Certificate",
    template: CocTemplate,
  },
];
```

- `templates` must be an array, where each element corresponds to a view (or a tab). Here it needs only one view.
- Each view must define the following properties:
  - `id` must be a unique identifier for this template configuration.
  - `label` will display in a tab in the application, which loads the renderer.
  - `template` is the component that will display.

### Renderer template configuration

`src/templates/index.tsx` is a file containing the configuration of all the templates available in this renderer.

To register a new template, add it as a key to the `registry` constant. 

>**Note:** The key is case sensitive and must match the `$template.name` value defined in the [document data](#updating-the-sample-document-data-and-type).

To add the new `COC` template, replace the `src/templates/index.tsx` file content with the following code:

```js
import { TemplateRegistry } from "@govtechsg/decentralized-renderer-react-components";
import { templates } from "./coc";

export const registry: TemplateRegistry<any> = {
  COC: templates,
};
```

If you open `src/index.tsx`, you will notice the `registry` defined above is used and provided to a component called `FramedDocumentRenderer`. This component will handle the connection to the application automatically and display the correct component depending on your configuration. For more information, see [this github repository](https://github.com/Open-Attestation/decentralized-renderer-react-components).

You are ready to build your document renderer and deploy it online.

## Deploying the document renderer

### Push code to GitHub

Create a new GitHub repository and push the code there. 

For a step-by-step guide on importing source code to GitHub, read [this guide](https://help.github.com/en/github/importing-your-projects-to-github/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line).

### Deploy the site onto Netlify

Once you have your code on GitHub, build and deploy the site onto [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

1. Log into [Netlify](https://netlify.com). 

2. Open your team's dashboard. Click **Sites** on the left navigation. The "Add your site to Netlify" page displays.

3. In the "Import an existing project" section, click **Import from Git**.

![Import from Git](/docs/developer-section/quickstart/custom-renderer/netlify-new.png)

4. Select **Deploy with GitHub**. The authorization page displays. 

    Authorize your GitHub account and select your repository. 

![Deploy from GitHub](/docs/developer-section/quickstart/custom-renderer/netlify-deploy.png)

5. Review the configuration for your repository. 

    In the "Build settings" section: 

    a. For "Build command", enter `npm run build`.

    b. For "Publish Directory", enter `dist`. 

    c. Configure other settings as you need.


![Build settings](/docs/developer-section/quickstart/custom-renderer/netlify-build.png)

6. Click **Deploy <Repository_Name>**.

7. Once the site has been deployed, you will get the URL to the document renderer site. 

    In this example, the URL is `https://frosty-joliot-c02c3d.netlify.com/`. The website will be an empty page when you view it directly. This is normal, because it is not meant for direct viewing through a web browser.

![Sample Deployed URL](/docs/developer-section/quickstart/custom-renderer/netlify-deployed.png)


>**Important:** Save the website URL for future reference. You should also update `$template.url` in your OA document.

## Additional note for production document renderer

It is recommended to use a custom domain you own for the document renderer website in production. This prevents locking in to any specific third-party hosting provider.

If you are using Netlify, check out [how to enable custom domains](https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/custom-domains/).
