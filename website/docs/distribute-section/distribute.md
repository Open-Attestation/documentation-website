The OpenAttestation framework does not take into account how the document holder will be able to obtain the OA documents. They can be distributed through traditional channels such as email, messaging apps, and shared drives. 

While the issuer is distributing the OA documents, it is helpful to provide the holder with proper instructions on how to perform the verification.

To guide the holder on how to view or verify the `.oa` document as an attachment, the following shows a simple example for an email template: 

1. Save the `.oa` document attached to the email on your device.
1. Open the web browser and visit `<your preferred verifier>`.
1. Drag the `.oa` document and drop it into the file selection pane.
1. If the document is successfully verified, a new page will display the document content with three green checkmarks.

>**Note:** Be sure to come up with your own instructions that are customized for the specific use case.
