When the users are handling the raw OA documents, they may come across the following difficulties: 

* The `.oa` files cannot be viewed directly.
* There is currently no built-in support for the `.oa` format on operating systems.
* The users need to bring the `.oa` files with them all the time.


To solve these issues, the users need to embed the `.oa` documents into file formats that are convenient to view and to store. 

The convenient file formats include: 

* **QR code:** This can be shown to the verifying party on spot.
* **Clickable link:** This can be an HTML file with a link inside. With a click, the user can open the `.oa` document in a web browser.
* **Shortened link:** This is the shortened form of a regular link. It works in the same way as the clickable link.
