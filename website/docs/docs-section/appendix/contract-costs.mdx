Here is an estimated breakdown of the gas and costs involved when interacting with the contracts.
You should be aware that the estimated gas required can differ slightly depending on the states of the contract when called. The gas prices and fiat costs are constantly changing and you should check the numbers from a source you trust to get an accurate figure.

:::note
Note that the following estimation is _not_ a comprehensive list of all the costs involved and should be used as a reference only.

The live (updated every 30s) gas _average_ and ETH prices used in the estimations are retrieved from [ETHGasStation](https://ethgasstation.info/) and [CryptoCompare](https://www.cryptocompare.com/) respectively.

### Verifiable Documents

<PriceTable type="verifiable" />

### Transferable Documents

<PriceTable type="transferable" />

:::note
The estimated gas may change along with the updates we have to the contracts. The current estimation is based on Document Store v2.2.3 and Token Registry v3.0.0.
