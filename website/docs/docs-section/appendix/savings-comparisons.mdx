Are you a new user of TradeTrust or looking at deploying a new Token Registry (Transferable Documents)? If you are, we recommend you try out our new V4.

Not only will you be able to try out the new features in this version, you will also enjoy massive cost savings when deploying your contracts!
This page gives an estimated breakdown of the differences in gas fees between the two versions and how much savings you can make when using the new V4.

The V4 contracts can help to save up to about 92% in total gas fees compared to its previous versions.
If the costs on Ethereum is still a concern despite the savings, you can consider deploying onto the Polygon network, which this V4 repository comes preconfigured with.
The estimations on this page are based on the current prices on the Ethereum and Polygon mainnet.

Now, if you are convinced to try our new V4, check out our repository [here](https://github.com/Open-Attestation/token-registry/tree/master)! ðŸŽ‰
