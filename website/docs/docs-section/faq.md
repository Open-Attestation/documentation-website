#### What are OpenAttestation documents?

OpenAttestation documents are verifiable documents, or Verifiable Credentials, as commonly referred to by the tech community. 

As our transactions become increasingly digital, there is a need to ensure that the legitimacy of credentials such as certificates, licenses or permits can be verified. 

OpenAttestation documents are cryptographically secure and hence tamper-resistant. OpenAttestation also allows anyone to check who issued the document, or whether the document has been revoked so that it is no longer valid. These verifications are always performed at the point of viewing, or in other words, before the document is being displayed. 

#### How are OpenAttestation documents distributed?

Today, the distribution of OpenAttestation documents falls into 2 broad categories: 

1. By link 
    - Sharing a URL/scanning a QR code

2. By document transmission 
    - Sending the original OpenAttestation document (OA document) 
    - Sending a HTML page (embedded with OA document)
    - Sending document as PDF with QR code for verification

Below are the pros and cons of each approach.

            <th>Method</th>
            <th>Pros</th>

#### How can I have an estimation of the costs involved in using the smart contracts?

You can refer to the page [Contract Costs](/docs/docs-section/appendix/contract-costs) for a breakdown of the estimations.

#### What is gas?

For more information on Gas and Gas Prices, check out [this article](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/3/what-is-meant-by-the-term-gas)

#### What is the theoretical storage limit of a smart contract?

It is `2^261` bytes. Check out this stackoverflow [post](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/1038/is-there-a-theoretical-limit-for-amount-of-data-that-a-contract-can-store/1040#1040) for more information.

#### Can I create multiple TXT records under the same domain/subdomain?

Yes. You can make use of multiple TXT records to point to multiple Ethereum addresses (e.g. document stores or DIDs). Keep in mind each TXT record should only contain one Ethereum address record.
