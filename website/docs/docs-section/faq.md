### What are OpenAttestation documents?

OpenAttestation documents (OA documents) are a type of verifiable documents or verifiable credentials.

As our transactions become increasingly digital, there is a need to ensure that the legitimacy of credentials such as certificates, licenses or permits is verifiable. 

OpenAttestation documents are cryptographically secure and hence tamper-resistant. OpenAttestation also helps any user check who issued the document, and whether the document has been revoked so that it is no longer valid. These verifications are always performed at the point of viewing (before the document displays).

### What can I do using the OpenAttestation framework?

You can perform the following actions using the OA framework:

>**Note:** In the diagrams below, "source" means the user's local machine where the request comes from.

* Create a wallet or DID

* Deploy document store

* Create raw documents

* Wrap documents (see the diagram above)

* Issue documents using Ethereum or sign documents using DID

![Issue or revoke documents](/docs/docs-section/faq/issue-or-revoke.png)

* Revoke documents (see the diagram above)

* Verify the OA documents with a compatible verifier

* Distribute the OA documents using any of the [Universal Actions](https://github.com/Open-Attestation/adr/blob/master/universal_actions.md#universal-actions-for-open-attestation-documents)

* Developers can use the libraries and code samples to develop software applications.


### Can I use a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for OpenAttestation documents?

You can use the [Toolkit](https://toolkit.openattestation.com/) to perform the following tasks with ease:

* Wrap or unwrap an OA document
* Verify documents
* Get OpenAttestation DNS TXT records
* Diagnose an OA document
* Encrypt or decrypt an OA document
* Create a [Universal Action](https://github.com/Open-Attestation/adr/blob/master/universal_actions.md#universal-actions-for-open-attestation-documents) to share an OA document

### How are OpenAttestation documents distributed?

The distribution of OpenAttestation documents falls into two broad categories: 

1. By link 
    - Sharing a URL/scanning a QR code

2. By document transmission 
    - Sending the original OpenAttestation document (OA document)
    - Sending an HTML page (with an OA document embedded)
    - Sending the document as a PDF with a QR code for verification

Below are the pros and cons of each approach.

### How can I have an estimation of the costs involved in using the smart contracts?

See the page [Contract Costs](/docs/docs-section/appendix/contract-costs) for a breakdown of the cost estimation.

### What is gas?

For more information on gas and gas prices, check out [this article](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/3/what-is-meant-by-the-term-gas).

### What is the theoretical storage limit of a smart contract?

It is `2^261` bytes. Check out [this Stack Exchange post](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/1038/is-there-a-theoretical-limit-for-amount-of-data-that-a-contract-can-store/1040#1040) for more information.

### Can I create multiple TXT records under the same domain/subdomain?

Yes. You can make use of multiple TXT records to point to multiple Ethereum addresses (e.g. document stores or DIDs). Keep in mind each TXT record should only contain one Ethereum address record.

### Why do I have to pay for at least one transaction while choosing the DID method?

[This article](/docs/docs-section/how-does-it-work/comparison#price) mentioned that if you use DID documents, you don't need to pay for transactions. This happens when you use DID for issuance and OCSP for revocation. 

However, if you use DID for issuance and a `documentStore` for revocation, you still need to have at least one transaction with the Ethereum blockchain to deploy a `documentStore`.

### Although I did not issue any documents from the deployed document store, why can I revoke this document?

That's because the revocation mapping in the `documentStore` is separate from the issued mapping.
