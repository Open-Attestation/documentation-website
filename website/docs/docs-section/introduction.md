OpenAttestation is an open source framework for verifiable documents and transferable records.

## Verifiable document

A verifiable document is a tamper-evident document that cryptographically proves who issued it. They are the electronic equivalent of the physical documents, such as plastic cards, passports, driving licenses, qualifications and awards, etc.

## Transferable records

Transferable records are extended verifiable documents that define a method for identifying the owner of the record at any given time. These records reference properties listed in [the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records](https://uncitral.un.org/en/texts/ecommerce/modellaw/electronic_transferable_records). Currently, the OA framework's implementation of this is based on [ERC721 NFTs](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721).

Therefore, you can use transferable records for documents such as:

- Title Deeds
- Bills of Lading
