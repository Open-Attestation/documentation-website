OpenAttestation is an open source framework for verifiable document and transferable records.

## Verifiable Document

A verifiable document (or verifiable credential) is a tamper-evident document that cryptographically proves who issued it. They are the electronic equivalent of the physical documents that we all possess today, such as: plastic cards, passports, driving licences, qualifications and awards, etc

## Transferable Records

Transferable Records are documents which extends on Verifiable Documents to allow a document to have an owner. These records references properties laid out in the [UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records](https://www.uncitral.org/pdf/english/texts/electcom/MLETR_ebook.pdf)

This allow Transferable Records to be used for documents like:

- Title Deeds
- Bill of Ladings
