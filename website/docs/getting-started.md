OpenAttestation is an open source framework for verifiable document and transferable records.

## Verifiable Document

A verifiable document (or verifiable credential) is a tamper-evident document that cryptographically proves who issued it. They are the electronic equivalent of the physical documents that we all possess today, such as: plastic cards, passports, driving licences, qualifications and awards, etc

## Transferable Records

Transferable Records are Verifiable Documents which have been extended to define a method for resolution of the owner at any point in time. These records reference properties laid out in the [UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records](https://uncitral.un.org/en/texts/ecommerce/modellaw/electronic_transferable_records). Currently, our only implementation of this is based on [ERC721 NFTs](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721).

This allows Transferable Records to be used for documents such as:

- Title Deeds
- Bills of Lading
