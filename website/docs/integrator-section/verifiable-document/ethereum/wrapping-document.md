import WrapSingleDocument from "/src/reusables/_wrap-single-document.mdx";

Every OA document has a checksum that provides it a tamper-proof property. At the same time, because the checksum can be used to uniquely identify a document, the checksum (or its derived value) is stored onto the document store as evidence of issuance. To compute the checksum, a `raw document` goes through a process known as `wrapping` to become a `wrapped document`. Only then, the document is ready to be issued onto the blockchain.

Multiple documents can be wrapped at the same time in a single batch operation, creating a single checksum for the entire batch of raw documents. This is especially useful when using document store on the Ethereum blockchain to lower the transaction cost and time.

In this task, we will learn how to generate the checksum by running the `wrapping` process.

We will use the CLI tool to read all the files in the `raw-documents` folder, wrap them and then output the files in another directory `wrapped-documents`.

A `merkleRoot`, a 64 character long string prepended with `0x` will be generated. The `merkleRoot` is the only information that will be stored onto the Blockchain to verify the issuance status of an OA document.

## Running the wrap command

From the folder containing the `raw-documents` folder, run the command:

```sh
open-attestation wrap raw-documents --output-dir wrapped-documents
```

## Getting the response

In the response, you will see the success message with the `Batch Document Root`. 

```sh
âœ”  success   Batch Document Root: 0x80cc53b77c0539fc383f8d434ac5ffad281f3d64ae5a0e59e9f36f19548e1fff
```

## Saving the merkle root
In the above sample, the batch document root (also known as "merkle root") is `0x80cc53b77c0539fc383f8d434ac5ffad281f3d64ae5a0e59e9f36f19548e1fff`, you will definitely have a different value.

Save this value for future reference.

## Viewing the wrapped documents

At the same time, you will notice that another directory `wrapped-documents` has been created:

```text
wallet.json
raw-documents
  |-- certificate-1.json
  |-- certificate-2.json
wrapped-documents
  |-- certificate-1.json
  |-- certificate-2.json
```

In the `wrapped-documents` directory, you will find the wrapped document which can be sent to the recipient later, once the `merkleRoot` has been issued to the document store.

## Wrapping a single document
This is an alternative way. Instead of wrapping all documents in a folder in a batch, you can also wrap a single document at a time.

<WrapSingleDocument />
