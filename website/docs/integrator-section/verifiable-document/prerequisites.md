Before getting started, you will need to set up the OpenAttestation CLI correctly. 

Follow the steps on the [intallation page](/docs/developer-section/libraries/remote-files/open-attestation-cli), and make sure the following command returns the OA version number:

```bash
open-attestation --version
```

>**Note:** If you need to change the binary name or the path to the binary, be sure to change the example above and the commands we will run throughout the guide.
