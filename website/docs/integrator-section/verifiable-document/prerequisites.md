Before getting started, you will need to set up the OpenAttestation CLI correctly. 

## System requirements
The OA commands are compatible with UNIX-based operating systems (e.g. Linux or iOS). If your computer is running on the Windows operating system, you need to adjust some commands into Windows equivalent.

## Installing OA CLI and checking the version
Follow the steps on the [intallation page](/docs/developer-section/libraries/remote-files/open-attestation-cli), and make sure the following command returns the OA version number:

```bash
open-attestation --version
```

>**Note:**If you need to change the binary name or the path to the binary, be sure to change the example above and the commands we will run throughout the guide.
