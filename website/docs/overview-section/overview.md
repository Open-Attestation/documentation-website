OpenAttestation is an open source framework for verifiable documents and transferable records.

## Verifiable document

A verifiable document is a tamper-evident document that cryptographically proves who issued it. They are the electronic equivalent of the physical documents, such as plastic cards, passports, driving licenses, qualifications and awards, etc.

## Transferable records

Transferable records are extended verifiable documents that define a method for identifying the owner of the record at any given time. These records reference properties listed in [the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records](https://uncitral.un.org/en/texts/ecommerce/modellaw/electronic_transferable_records). Currently, the OA framework's implementation of this is based on [ERC721 NFTs](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721).

Therefore, you can use transferable records for documents such as:

- Title Deeds
- Bills of Lading

## Building with OpenAttestation

There are three types of roles who build documents, solutions, or services with the OpenAttestation framework.

### Integrator

An integrator intends to issue/verify OpenAttestation documents or transferable records.

### Developer

A developer intends to build their platform or services on top of OpenAttestation.

### Contributor

A contributor intends to make contribution to OpenAttestation.

Creating verifiable documents is the fundamental feature of the OpenAttestation (OA) framework. 

In this quick start guide, you will learn how to deploy a verifiable document.

## Goal

At the end of this guide, you will be able to create your ðŸ“œ Certificate of Completion that is valid on any compatible OA Viewer. The following guides are available:

- Use OpenAttestation with [DID](/docs/integrator-section/verifiable-document/did/create)
- Use OpenAttestation with [Ethereum Smart Contract](/docs/integrator-section/verifiable-document/ethereum/document-store-overview)


## Additional feature

If you need to distribute the document to another user, see these articles:

* [Embedding a verifiable document into an HTML file](/docs/developer-section/quickstart/oa-embedded-html)
* [Embedding a verifiable document into a QR code (URL)](/docs/developer-section/quickstart/oa-embedded-qrcode)
