>**Important**: Transferable records are unable to be revoked. Instead, you can choose to surrender a transferable record to freeze the records in the document. In this way, they can no longer be used for transfers, but are still valid for verification.

Depending on how the verifiable documents were issued, choose one of the revocation methods below:

- Revoke verifiable documents issued with DID
    - [Using document store](/docs/did-section/revoke-document-did/revoke-using-document-store)
    - [Using OCSP](/docs/did-section/revoke-document-did/revoke-using-ocsp)
- Revoke verifiable documents issued with Ethereum
    - [Using document store](/docs/ethereum-section/revoke-document-eth/revoke-eth)

To learn more about the differences between revocation methods, see [this article](/docs/revoke-section/diff-btw-revocation-methods).
