To revoke verifiable documents, choose one of the methods below depending on how they were issued:

- Revoke verifiable documents issued with DID
    - [Using document store](/docs/test2-section/revoke-document-did/revoke-using-document-store)
    - [Using OCSP](/docs/test2-section/revoke-document-did/revoke-using-ocsp)
- Revoke verifiable documents issued with Ethereum
    - [Using document store](/docs/test3-section/revoke-document-eth/revoke-eth)

>**Important**: Transferable records are unable to be revoked. Instead, you can choose to surrender a transferable record to freeze the records in the document. In this way, they can no longer be used for transfers, but are still valid for verification.
