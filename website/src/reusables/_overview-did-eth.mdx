### DNS records

A domain is required to issue an OA document. A DNS record must be inserted to the DNS to assert the identity of the OA document creator.

### Verifiable document file

A Verifiable Document File is also known as the OA document. Machine-readable data of the OA document is stored in a `.json` file. In addition to the data, these `.json` files also contain information such as:

- claim of issuer's identity
- document rendering information
- document store smart contract

### Decentralized renderer

The decentralized renderer gives the OA document a human-readable look. It is essentially a website which will take an OA document data as input and display the document in a web view. Using this feature, any user can style their document without submitting code change to another party.
